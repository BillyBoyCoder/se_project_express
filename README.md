# Project 12 - Working with ExpressJS

## Objective

Over the last two sprints, you built the front end for your "WTWR" project. The back-end projects will focus on creating a server for "WTWR". While working on this, you'll learn how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy your web application on a remote machine. The goal of all this is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

At this stage, you'll:

- Set up an Express project
- Create a database and connect it to the server
- Configure the first routes and controllers

As a stretch goal, you'll refine your application's error handling, but this won't be due until Project 13.
